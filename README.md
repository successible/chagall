# Chagall

ðŸŽ¨ Tiny CSS framework (4kb) to make websites look good.

Chagall is inspired by `simple.css` and `tailwind.css`. It was designed to reduce:

- The bundle size of any client application.
- The amount of `css` that must be written.

Chagall was originally created for the calorie tracker [Clean Slate](https://github.com/successible/cleanslate).

To use Chagall, add `chagall.scss` into your project. This will automatically style elements like `h2`. You can also use utility classes, like `mt10` or `fcs`.

> Note: If you are using CSS-in-JS, like `emotion`, you can also import `chagall.ts`. This file defines the SCSS color and layout variables in TypeScript.
